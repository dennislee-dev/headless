			<p>----</p>
			<h1 className="font-bold">ARTICLE 1 - PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED</h1>
			<p>
				When you make a purchase from our store, as part of our buying and selling process, we
				collect the personal information you provide, such as your name, address and e-mail address.
				<br />
				<br />
				When you browse our store, we also automatically receive the Internet Protocol (IP) address of
				your computer, which allows us to obtain more details about the browser and operating system
				you use.
				<br />
				<br />
				E-mail Marketing (if applicable): With your permission, we may send you emails about our store,
				new products and other updates.
			</p>
			<h1 className="font-bold">ARTICLE 2 - CONSENT</h1>
			<p>
				How do you obtain my consent?
				<br />
				<br />
				When you provide us with your personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit
				card, place an order, schedule a delivery or return a purchase, we will assume that you consent
				to our collection and use of your information for that purpose only.
				<br />
				<br />
				If we ask you to provide your personal information for any other reason, such as marketing purposes,
				we will ask you directly for your express consent, or we will give you the opportunity to decline.
				<br />
				<br />
				How do I withdraw my consent?
				<br />
				<br />
				If, after you have given us your consent, you change your mind and no longer consent to our contacting
				you, collecting your information or disclosing it, you may notify us by contacting us at contact@heybreal.com
			</p>
			<h1 className="font-bold">ARTICLE 3 - DISCLOSURE</h1>
			<p>
				We may disclose your personal information if we are required to do so by law or if you
				violate our Terms and Conditions.
			</p>
			<h1 className="font-bold">ARTICLE 4 - SHOPIFY</h1>
			<p>
				Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that
				allows us to sell our services and products to you.
				<br />
				<br />
				Your data is stored in Shopify&apos;s data storage system and databases, and in the general Shopify
				application. Your data is kept on a secure server protected by a firewall.
			</p>
			<h1 className="font-bold">Payment:</h1>
			<p>
				If you make your purchase through a direct payment gateway, in that case Shopify will store
				your credit card information. This information is encrypted in accordance with the Payment
				Card Industry Data Security Standard PCI-DSS. Your purchase transaction information is
				retained for as long as necessary to complete your order. Once your order is finalized, your
				purchase transaction information is deleted.
				<br />
				<br />
				All direct payment gateways are PCI-DSS compliant, managed by the PCI Security Standards Council,
				which is a joint effort of companies such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
				<br />
				<br />
				PCI-DSS requirements ensure the secure processing of credit card data by our store and its service
				providers.
				<br />
				<br />
				For more information, please see the Shopify Terms of Service here or the Privacy Policy here.
			</p>
			<h1 className="font-bold">ARTICLE 5 - SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES</h1>
			<p>
				Generally, the third-party providers we use will only collect, use and disclose your
				information to the extent necessary to perform the services they provide to us.
				<br />
				<br />
				However, some third party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction
				processors, have their own privacy policies regarding the information we are required to provide
				to them for your purchase transactions.
				<br />
				<br />
				With respect to these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies carefully
				so that you can understand how they will handle your personal information.
				<br />
				<br />
				Keep in mind that some suppliers may be located or have facilities located in a different jurisdiction
				than you or us. So if you decide to proceed with a transaction that requires the services of
				a third party supplier, then your information may be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction
				in which that supplier is located or the jurisdiction in which its facilities are located.
				<br />
				<br />
				For example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed through a payment
				gateway located in the United States, your information used to complete the transaction may be
				disclosed under United States law, including the Patriot Act.
				<br />
				<br />
				Once you leave our store site or are redirected to a third party website or application, you
				are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website&apos;s Terms and Conditions of Sale
				and Use.

				You may leave our website by clicking on certain links on our site. We assume no
				responsibility for the privacy practices of these other sites and recommend that you read
				their privacy policies carefully.

			<p>
				To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry
				best practices to ensure that it is not lost, misappropriated, accessed, disclosed, altered
				or destroyed in an inappropriate manner.
				<br />
				<br />
				If you provide us with your credit card information, it will be encrypted through the use of
				the SSL security protocol and stored with AES-256 encryption. While no method of transmission
				over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all the requirements of the
				PCI-DSS and implement additional generally accepted industry standards.
